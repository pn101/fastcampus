# Algorithm

A set of instructions to solve problems.

##Time Complexity
* Time is prioritised over memory usage.
* big O notation
	* for i in range(N):
		- O(N)
	* for i in range(N):
	  	for j in range(N):
	  		- O(N**2)

* Calculating the time for worst case scenarios

* the O refers to the Order of the Fuction
