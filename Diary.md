##Week 1

###Day 1
We learnt that computers are fundementally calculators and that mathmeticians discovered that computers think in 0's and 1's.

Computer Configuration
* Hardware
	* Input, Output, Memory, CPU, Controller

* Software
	* System Software
	* Application Software

Computer Architecture
* Harvard Architecture
	* Fast speed
	* Instruction Memory and Data Memory are separate
	* Expensive and difficult to design and operate

* Von Neumann Architecture
	* Instruction Memory and Data Memory are not separated
	* Computer may not always be able to differentiate between Instruction Meory and Data Memory
	* Slower speed
	* Cheaper and easier to design

Binary Numbers
* Computers understand 0's and 1'
* Humans use a base-10 numerical system
* Computers use a base-2 numerical system (binary)
